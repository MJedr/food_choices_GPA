# food_choices_GPA
This is a small ML project based on food choices dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/borapajo/food-choices">Kaggle</a>. My goal is to build a model which will predict GPA based on some basic information on student, such as:  

- gender, mother's and father's profession ,
- food choices like:
    - which type of soup you prefere to eat, *veggie* or *creamy*,
    - which type of comfort food fo you like the most,
    - how much do you like Thai food?  

Additionaly, to enable easier exploratory data analysis a simple *Dash* app will be provided to visualise data.
